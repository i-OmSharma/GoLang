* Go = C + Strings + Garbage Collection + Concurency.

1. Strong and static types programming language.
    - variable can't be changed overtime and must be defined compile time.
    - helps in capture error in compile time easily.
 
 2. Compile Time: GO is desgined fr faster compilation without the need of dependency checking.
 
 
3. String porcessing: frequent process and analyzes large amount of text data, require efficient manipulation of string.
    - Go has Compregensive set of string functions, which also uses grabege collection to make working string more effecient compared to some other languages like c++.

4. Concurency: In Go refereces to the ability of a program to execute mutiple taks independently but not necessarily simultaniously. 
    - It's about structuring ur program in a way that allow different parts of it run indendently, making efficient use of available resources.
    
    
* while concurency is about managing many taks , parallelism is about executing taks simultaniously.

5. In Go, a goroutine is lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

6. Lightweight: Goroutine takes only 8 kilobyte and u can have thousands of them.

7. Zero Dependency.

8. Built in for testing.

9. go mod communicate with go Path.

10. Go Modules simplifyt the maagementb of dependenies and project structure.

11. go.mod file contains informations about ur project, including its name and depedencies.

12. There is no classes in GO, everything is Package.

13. No concept of OOPs. struct and interfaces is used for concepts of OOPs.

14. Packages are Project directiries. Every .go file start with package name.

15. Program start with "main" package, which includes "main()" function.

16. Go uses relative imports.

17. Packages are tightly coupled with directiries.

18. In GO for a file to the entry point of an executable porgram, it must belong to the main package adn contain a mian function.

19. When u use "go run" command to execute a GO porgram, the GO runtime looks for the main function in the main Package and execute it.

20. File name can be anything,but package name should be same for each file in that dir.

21. if u want to use differentr package name u can make sub dir in the parent dir. And make imports and use them.

22. Package name should be same inside all files in a dir, but file names can be different in a dir.

23. variable name should be capital (first letter) to make that variable resuable, and used in another dir or files exportable- accessable from other Packages. If u intialise a vairable with small then it will be only used in that file only. Only within the same package.
    - same goes for funciton , PublifcFuncion() -> Publically, exportable.
    - same rule for, privateFunction() -> private, non exportable.
    
24. "Printf" print formatted, allow u to controll the output by using format specifiers similart as c.

25. "Scan" user input, but it reads until the first whitespace character.
    - Go (basic fmt.Scan) space ke baad input cut kar deta hai, because it only reads a single token.
    - to counter this: u need to use "bufio" package's "NewScanner" or "ReadString" function for more complex scenarios.
    - bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
    - to use "bufio" we make reader. Buffer reader is created that reads from standard inputs.(os.Stdin)
    
26. Buffer Reader is a type of reader, thart reads data frim an underlying source, such as a file or standard input(keyboard or mouse), and store data in buffer. The buffer is a teporary storage area in memory. Buffer reader are commonly used to improve the effeciency on imput operations. 

27. In Go, the underscore(_) is used as a blank indentifier. It serves as a white-only variable that allows you to discard values return by a function ot to ignore specific value when you are not intrested in using them.

28. Arrays are declared using the syntax "var name [size] type", when name is the array variable, "size" is the number of elements and "type" is the data type of the elements.

29. Arrays have fixed size,size must be intialise at the time of declared. 

30. To find lenght of an array we use len(array_name).

31. Access index of array same as other languages, arrary_name[index].

32. Default value of Data types:

+---------------------------+----------------------+
| Category                  | Default (Zero Value)|
+---------------------------+----------------------+
| All numeric types         | 0                    |
|   (int, uint, float, etc) |                      |
| Boolean                   | false                |
| String                    | ""                   |
| Pointer                   | nil                  |
| Slice                     | nil                  |
| Map                       | nil                  |
| Channel                   | nil                  |
| Interface                 | nil                  |
| Struct                    | Fields ki zero value |
+---------------------------+----------------------+


33. "%q" --> quoted string.

34. A slice is a flexible and dynamic DS. 
    Slice is same as ArrayList in java.
    
35. Unlike arrys slices have a dynamic size, and their length can be changed suring the program execution.

36. TO know about data Type we use "%T" with fmt.Printf.

37. make is used to allocate and initialize slices, maps and channels.
    under the hood it uses "struct" data type.
    
    -- type slice struct {
            ptr *T
            len int
            cap int
        }

38. it takes data type, length, capacity.

39. if capacity is not given, capacity = length.
    - make allows creating a slice with predefined length and capacity.
    - when we use "make" it becomes custom u can assign any value to and make slice according to u.
    
40. capacity grows automatically on append (growth is implementation dependent),
    when requirement increases the capacity double its size.
    
41. length increases only when elements are added
    
42. Go precedence relevant part:
    - () highest  
    - &&
    - ||
43. Expression inside a () becomes a unit.
    - the & is applied
    - || is least
    
44. Execution → left to right

45. Switch is same as other languages.

46. There is only 1 loop in Go that is for loop.

47. We can modify the for loop writing style to convert it into, for, while, infinite, or for certain range.

48. infinite loop + breake is while.

49. The "range" keyword simplifies loop over eleemnt of a conllection like slices, arrays, maps and Strings.

50. "range" simplifies the process of iterating over elements in various types of Collection such as slices, arrays, maps and strings.
        - It provides both the index(or the key in the case of maps) adn the value of each element in the Collection.
        
51. "breake" to exit a lop prematurely or "continue" to move to the next iteration.

52. There is no do-while loop in Go, but you can achive similar behaviuour using a for loop with a optional check at the end.

53. "new" operator is used to allocate memory for a value of a given type and return a pointer to it.

54. Returns a pointer (*T).

55. A pointer is a variable that store the memory address of another variable.

56. Pointer are used to indirectly refer to the value stored in a variable, rather then the value itself.

57. They provide a way to with memory directly, which can be useful for various programming tasks, including memory management and sharing data between functions. 

58. To declare a pointer use "*", and to initilaize the pointer use address-of "&".

59. default pointer is nil.

Vaiable in GO-

var - normal vaiable, this can be changed.
const - this is constant type.
:= - this is only used inside the function, same as js let.


Format specifiers:

    - %d: Integer
    - %s: String
    - %T: Tells the type of the value
    - %.3f: Float values(The number after the dot in %f pecifies the precision for the floatin-point numbers)


\n new line 

Error

value, err := SomeFunction()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error", err)
    return
}
fmt.println(value)


Arrays:
Declaration:

var name[size] type, name is the array variable , size number of element, type is data type
